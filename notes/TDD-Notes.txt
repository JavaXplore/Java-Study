TDD ToDo concepts:
A] Mocito
	1) Creating mocks
	2) Stubbing methods
	3) Argument Matching
	4) Stubbing consecutive calls
	5) Verification order
	6) Capturing Arguments (ArgumentCaptors)
	7) Partial mocks (Spy)
		We can not mock private and static methods.
B] PowerMockito and static method stubbing
	a) Steps:
		1) @RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
		2) @PrepareForTest(value={StaticClass.class})
		3) PowerMockito.mockStatic(StaticMethodClass)
		4) PowerMockito when then
		5) PowerMockito.verifyStatic()

	b) PowerMockito.whenNew() 
	c) PowerMockito helps to stub the private and final methods. This is achived because PowerMock works on bytecode manipulation while classloading
	d)PowerMockito.verifyPrivate
	e) Read WhiteBox class
C] DB testing
	Check DBUnit more for testing DB/DAO code.
	DBUnit helps for below things:
		Connections
		Database Operations
		Data sets
